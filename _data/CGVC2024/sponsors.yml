  intro: Advanced Infrastructure is faciliating a whole systems approach to the Energy Transition to Net Zero. We provide data and solutions to help understand the current energy baseline and take practical steps to cut carbon. Our award winning net zero software and data is supporting over 200 towns and cities, as well as some of the largest Distribution Network Operators in the UK to accelerate, identify and plan energy interventions across transport, heat, and generation. We work across a range of net zero use cases including forecasting network capacity, building retrofits, heat networks, and electric vehicle infrastructure deployment.
