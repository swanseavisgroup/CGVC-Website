<p>
    CGVC 2022, hosted by <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/">Aberystwyth University, UK</a>, is the 41st annual
    computer graphics, visualization, and visual computing conference organized by the Eurographics UK Chapter. The
    objective of Computer Graphics & Visual Computing (CGVC) is to foster greater exchange between visual computing
    researchers and practitioners, to welcome more researchers and industry partners in the UK, Europe, and beyond into
    this rapidly growing area of research. CGVC's scope includes all areas of visual computing, and a steadily more
    wide-spread visibility that achieves a more wide-spread impact.
</p>

<p>
    We welcome contributions in the form of full papers, short papers, viewpoint papers and extended abstracts
    (posters). Submissions are optionally single- or double-blind: authors may choose whether to anonymize their
    submission or not. Reviewers' identities are not revealed.
</p>

<h3>Full Papers</h3>
<p>
    A full paper submission is up to 8 pages describing completed research, plus 1 page of references only. Papers are
    refereed by members of the EGUK programme committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to give a 20-minute
    presentation at the conference. Accepted papers will appear in the Eurographics digital library and will serve as
    full paper publications.
</p>

<h3>Short Papers</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of short papers is to present late-breaking results, work-in -progress, and follow-up extensions or
    evaluations of existing methods. Short papers will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process by an international
    programme committee. They will be electronically archived and are fully citable publications. Submissions for the
    short paper track should be at most 4 pages, with an additional page allowed for references. Accepted short papers
    will be presented orally at the conference in (approximately) 12-15 minute presentations.
</p>

<h3>Viewpoint Papers</h3>
<p>
    CGVC also features a viewpoint paper track (also known as position paper) which enables researchers a new
    possibility to publish their ideas. Viewpoints articles offer detailed technical opinions on trends in visual
    computing or reports on how visual computing has contributed to the comprehension of data or phenomena. We encourage
    discussions of challenges or limitations in today's methods and areas of potential new research topics. We are also
    interested in application discussions that focus on the physical, life or social sciences, engineering, or commerce,
    for example, or related to the process of visual computing in general. We encourage an emphasis on lessons learned
    from practical experience for application discussions, particularly where visual computing has been employed in a
    real, working environment. Viewpoint papers are submitted with author names and affiliations. Accepted viewpoint
    papers will be electronically archived, are fully citable publications and will be presented orally at the
    conference in (approximately) 12-15 minute presentations.
</p>

<h3>Extended Abstracts / Posters</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this track is to present late-breaking results, work in progress, and follow-up extensions or
    evaluations of existing methods. In particular, it provides young researchers, especially postgraduate students,
    with valuable opportunities to receive feedback from other researchers, and engage in stimulating discussions. The
    poster track will be managed by the co-chair team and the International Programme Committee (IPC). We solicit poster
    submissions in the form of an extended abstract of at most 2 pages (with an additional page allowed for references
    only). Posters will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process. Accepted posters, size A1 recommended, will be
    presented at the poster viewing session of the conference.
</p>

<p>

    In addition to directly submitted posters, some submissions to the full, short and viewpoint paper tracks, that are
    not accepted for publication but are deemed suitable, will be offered an opportunity to be presented as posters.
    Such submissions will not require an additional review process.
</p>

<p>

    Traditionally, the materials in a poster/sketch can be reused later by the original authors for a more extensive
    publication (i.e., a full paper) with more detailed content and mature results. This should not be considered as
    self-plagiarism. However, as posters/sketches are citable, researchers are encouraged to acknowledge novel ideas and
    results presented in posters/sketches. A poster may describe a piece of work in any aspect of visual computing. For
    posters, we particularly encourage a summary report of collaborative projects, work-in-progress, and application
    case studies.
</p>

<p>
    Accepted abstracts do not appear in the Eurographics digital library. An extended abstract and industrial project
    abstract are not considered as a paper publication, instead being similar to a SIGGRAPH one‚Äêpage sketch or to a
    conference poster without an associated paper. As such, presenting an extended abstract at this conference has no
    effect on your ability to publish a fuller version of the same work in another venue.
