<h3>Keynote 1: From Data to Policy and Back – The Hidden Role of Visualisation in Decision-Making
</h3>
<h4>Dr.Mai Elshehaly - City, University of London</h4>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>Information visualisation presents countless opportunities for data-driven decision making. We have seen some
            of these
            opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic, when data-centric terminology such as “flattening the curve” was
            widely
            adopted and utilised in rationalising and communicating new policies to the public.
            Despite this communicative power of visualisation, there is a well-documented gap between the sensemaking
            and insight
            generation tasks that are well supported by visualisation on one hand and the processes of generating policy
            alternatives and selecting the most appropriate ones on another. Decision makers have several unmet needs
            when it comes
            to using data visualisation to support these processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this talk, I will highlight some of the unmet needs of policymakers, through a series of case studies in
            population
            health management. I will explain some of the knowledge gaps that hinder the ability of visualisation (and
            wider data
            science) tools to play a significant role in decisions concerning health service planning and commissioning
            and explore
            opportunities for visualisation research to tackle these gaps and sustain better connected decision
            workflows at the
            systems level.

    An Honorary Research Fellow at the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, Mai leads the visualisation research
    agenda at the Yorkshire and Humber Patient Safety Research Centre. She works closely with colleagues at local
    authorities and several partner organisations to deliver data literacy to over 30,000 young citizens in Bradford.
    Mai
    received a PhD in Computer Science from the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech, with a focus on
    scientific data visualisation. Her postdoctoral research experience included NSF- and NIHR-funded fellowships at the
    University of Maryland, Baltimore County and University of Leeds.

<h3>Keynote 2: Capture and Reproduction of Perceptual Reality</h3>
<h4>Dr. Rafał Mantiuk - University of Cambridge</h4>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>
            Today's computer graphics techniques make it possible to create
            imagery that is hardly distinguishable from photographs. However, a
            photograph is clearly no match to an actual real-world scene. I argue
            that the next big challenge is to achieve perceptual realism by
            creating artificial imagery that would be hard to distinguish from
            reality. This requires profound changes in the entire imaging
            pipeline, from acquisition and rendering to display, with a strong
            focus on visual perception.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this talk, I will outline the challenges that we need to overcome to reach perceptual realism and will
            give several
            examples of solutions that bring us close to that goal. This will include the work on the high-dynamic-range
            multi-focal
            stereo display, which let us achieve perceptual parity with the real world - a level of fidelity at which
            observers
            confused a real object with its virtual counterpart. I will also talk about visual models and metrics, which
            let us
            quantify the results in graphics and control rendering methods.

<h5>Bio</h5>

<p>
    Rafał K. Mantiuk is a Professor of Graphics and Displays at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, the
    University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. He received PhD from the Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science in
    Germany. His recent interests focus on computational displays, rendering and imaging algorithms that adapt to human
    visual performance and deliver the best image quality given limited resources, such as computation time or
    bandwidth. He
    contributed to early work on high dynamic range imaging, including quality metrics (HDR-VDP), video compression and
    tone-mapping.
