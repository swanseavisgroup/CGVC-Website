<h1> {{page.title}} </h1>

<p>We welcome full papers, short papers and poster (extended abstract) submissions to {{page.year}}.</p>

<h4>1. Formatting your paper</h4>
<p>Please use the <a href="documents/egPublStyle-{{page.year}}.zip">LaTeX
    template</a> and the <b>EGauthorGuidelines-{{page.year}}-sub.tex</a></b> file within for your initial submission.</p>
<p>Prepare your submission as a PDF file. You can also include material in other media such as applets and video. Note
  however that the camera-ready paper that is to appear in the proceedings must be PDF only. Please make sure that any
  images embedded in your paper do not contain transparent pixels (that is, an alpha channel of a transparent colour)
  because this will lead to problems when the resulting PDF is displayed.</p>
<p>Please follow the standard layout for EGUK publications. Details are in the LaTeX template (above) in <b>EGauthorGuidelines-{{page.year}}-sub.pdf</b>.
</p>

<h4>2. Submit your paper for review</h4>
<p>
  There are three submission streams:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Short Papers - </b>a short paper of up to 4 pages, demonstrating research, implementations and/or product
  development. Short papers will be presented at the conference site as 15 minute presentations, during a dedicated
  short paper session.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Posters - </b> Your extended abstract for your poster must be at most 2 pages, with 1 additional page allowed for references only. An extended
  abstract can describe work in progress, interim results, industrial work, or research presented more fully
  elsewhere. Extended abstracts will be refereed by a panel drawn from the EGUK programme committee. Authors of
  accepted abstracts will be expected to give a poster presentation at the conference.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Full papers -</b> a paper of 4 to 8 pages + one page of only references, describing completed research. Papers
  will be refereed by members of the EGUK programme committee. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to give a
  20 minute presentation at the conference.
</p>

<h4>3. If your paper is accepted</h4>
<p>
  Authors of papers approved for publication should read the reviewers comments, update and correct their paper from
  the reviewers comments, and submit a final version (a camera ready copy) to the conference management tool.
</p>
<p>
  Final papers must be formatted with an updated template: <a href="documents/egPublStyle-{{page.year}}.zip">
    LaTeX template</a> using either EGauthorGuidelines-{{page.year}}-fin_with_teaser.tex or EGauthorGuidelines-{{page.year}}-fin.tex (i.e. with <b>"-fin" in the filename</b>).
</p>
<p>
  Make sure your paper is formatted using the correct template, which makes correct reference to this year's
  editors.
</p>

<h4>4. Copyright form</h4>
<p>
  Authors of papers approved for publication will be required to complete and return this <a
    href="documents/ELF-EG-{{page.year}}.pdf">Eurographics copyright assignment form</a>. Authors are requested to
  complete the form and to upload a scanned-in copy directly to the submission system.
