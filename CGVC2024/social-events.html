    On the evening of the 14th, we will have a conference dinner hosted at Y Consti restaurant, which sits at the top of
    Constitution Hill at the seafront in Aberystwyth. This includes a ride up to the restaurant on Aberystwythâ€™s Cliff
    Railway, the longest electric funicular cliff railway in Britain!
